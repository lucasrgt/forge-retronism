/**
 * AeroMesh Model — container for triangulated OBJ models.
 *
 * Triangles are pre-classified into 4 brightness groups at parse time
 * (same directional system as Aero_ModelRenderer):
 *
 *   GROUP_TOP    (dominant ny, positive) → factor 1.0
 *   GROUP_BOTTOM (dominant ny, negative) → factor 0.5
 *   GROUP_NS     (dominant nz)           → factor 0.8
 *   GROUP_EW     (dominant nx)           → factor 0.6
 *
 * Classification happens during parsing (Aero_ObjLoader), not per frame.
 * This reduces setColorOpaque_F calls from O(N triangles) to 4.
 *
 * Each triangle is float[15]:
 *   [0-4]   vertex 0: x, y, z, u, v
 *   [5-9]   vertex 1: x, y, z, u, v
 *   [10-14] vertex 2: x, y, z, u, v
 *
 * Named groups (OBJ "o" / "g" directives):
 *   Triangles belonging to a named OBJ object/group are stored separately
 *   in namedGroups and excluded from the main groups array. This allows
 *   animated parts (fan, piston, gear) to be rendered independently with
 *   their own GL transforms, while the static geometry renders normally.
 *
 *   Example OBJ:
 *     o base      ← static, goes into groups[]
 *     ...faces...
 *     o fan       ← animated, goes into namedGroups["fan"]
 *     ...faces...
 *
 * The face normal is not stored — it was only used to classify the group.
